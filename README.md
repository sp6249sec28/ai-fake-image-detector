# AI Fake Image Detector

## Overview
This project detects fake (GAN-generated or AI-generated) images vs real images using deep learning. 
It also provides visual explainability (heatmaps) and an awareness section to help society understand AI-based image manipulation.

## Features
- Fake vs real image classification
- Explainability with Grad-CAM
- Awareness module for educating users
- Future plan: mobile/web version for easy access

## Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
- Grad-CAM for explainability
- Streamlit (for demo app)

## Social Impact
With the rise of deepfakes and AI-generated content, this tool can help individuals and organizations verify image authenticity and stay alert against misinformation.
